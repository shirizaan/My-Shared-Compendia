# SWADE Shared Compendia
A Foundry VTT module to share content between worlds via compendia as explained by u/solfolango on r/FoundryVTT; [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/fvw3c7/how_to_create_a_tiny_module_for_shared_content/ "here").
Its not hard to do, but you can jumpstart your efforts and just use this module.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

Manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shirizaan/swade-shared-compendium/main/module.json

🚨 Whenever there is an update,  👏 FoundryVTT  👏 will  👏 erase  👏 your  👏 compendia 👏.

Therefore you want to prevent FoundryVTT to **ever** update this module.
 
Alternatively, and better, modify this to your own local and custom module. 

### Unlock your Compendia!

*Remember* that you need to unlock your compendia to add to them.  

Compendia are locked by default, because every change you manually did will be reverted on an update. Thats why you need to break the update function. 


## Default Setup
This module comes with 11 compendia. One for each Type of Entity that is [supported by FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/article/compendium/ "supported by FoundryVTT") and several extra Item compendia, broken out in ways that duplicate the official SWADE modules.
